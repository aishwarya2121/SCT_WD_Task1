This is a simple responsive Landing Page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navbar stays fixed at the top of the page and changes its background color when the user scrolls down more than 50 pixels, creating a dynamic user experience.

*Features
1. Sticky navigation bar using position: fixed

2. Smooth background color transition on scroll

3.  Hover effects on navigation links

 4. Responsive design with Flexbox

* How It Works
  
When the user scrolls down more than 50px, a .scrolled class is added to the navbar.

This class changes the background color from black to pink using a smooth transition.

The navbar links also have a hover color effect (#ffcc00).
